# Rube Goldberg Starter Project

Author: Aries Liang

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3

It took me about 70 hours to complete this project. 

One thing I felt really challenging about this project is the inconsistency of object colliding behavior. As I searched online, Unity has its own way to determine if a collision should be discrete or continuous. Therefore it took me very long to find appropriate size for the colliders so that it feels natural when comes to grab and collide. 

However, I really like the flexibility and scalability of this project. Instead of using the environment provided, I thought of an idea that will make this project more scalable - the player is held captive by a witch in her dishwasher, and after he escape the dishwasher, he will need to escape the kitchen, living room, the wizard village... etc. Even though right now I only have time to finish the first part - the dishwasher escape. However, there are a lot of possibilities for future development on this idea. 

Also, I used Oculus to develop and test my project.
